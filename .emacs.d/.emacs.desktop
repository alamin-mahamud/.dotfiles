The proud parents are excited because the child excels, gets fair to good grades, and is accepted into a college.\nThe child graduates, maybe goes on to graduate school and then does exactly as programmed: looks for a safe, secure job or careeer.\nThe child finds that job, maybe as a doctor or a lawyer, or joins the Army or works for the govt. Generally, the child begins to make money, credit cards start to arrive\nin mass, and the shopping begins, if it already hasn't.\n\nNow i know I can choose a profession for the work I want to perform and not because of job security, benefits or howmuch I get paid. If I learn what\nthis game teaches, I'm free to do and study what my hear wants to study . . . rather thans tudy something because businesses are looking for certain job skills. If I\nlearn this, I won't have to worry about job security and Social Securtiy the way most of my classmates already do.\n\nchildren spends years in an antiquated educational system, studying subjects they will never use, preparing for a world that no longer exists.\n\nEmployees loose and owners and investors win.\n\nI don't care how many computers they put in the classroom, or how much money schools spend. How can the education system teach a subject that it does know?\n\nInstead of teaching my children to simply play it safe, I decided it was best to teach them to play it smart.\n\nJust as scholastic skills are needed, so as financial and communication skills.\n|------------------------+----------------------------|\n| Poor Dad               | Rich Dad                   |\n|------------------------+----------------------------|\n| work for a corporation | own the corporation        |\n| be a smart person      | learn to hire smart people |\n|------------------------+----------------------------|\n\n** Chapter - 1\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Poor Dad                                                               | Rich Dad                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| the love of money is the root of evil                                  | the lack of money is the root of all evil                                                                  |\n| I can't afford it?                                                     | How can I afford It?                                                                                       |\n|                                                                        | My brain get's stronger every day because I excercise it.

Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.\nThe mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. This self-knowledge, according to Japanese legend, was the most treasured of the three.\n\nIt is said that the fear of public speaking is a fear greater than death for most people.\nAccording to psychiatrists, the fear of public speaking is caused by the fear of ostracism, the fear of standing out,\nthe fear of criticism, the fear of ridicule, and the fear of being an outcast. The fear of being different prevents most people from seeking new ways to solve their problems\n\nhere was  a man who had not gone along witht the crowd.

And they usually respond\n\"No, I work there.\" In that instance, they have confused their profession with their business. Their profession may be a banker, but they still need their\nown business.\n\nThe mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else's business and making that person rich.\n\nThat is why we hear so often: \"I need a raise.\" \"If only I had a promotion.\" \"I am going back to school to get more training so I can get a better job.\" \"I am going to work overtime.\" \"Maybe I can get a second job.\"\n\n- Financial struggle is often the result of people working all their lives for someone else.\n\nIn my world, real assets fall into the following categories:\n1. Businesses that do not require my presence: I own them, but they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work there, it's not a business. It becomes my job.\n2. Stocks\n3. Bonds\n4. Income-generating real estate\n5. Notes(IOUs)\n6. Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents\n7. Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market.\n\nI also love stocks of small companies, especially start-ups, because I am an entrepreneur, not a corporate person.\nI like starting companies, not running them. So my stock buys are usually of small companies.\nSometimes I even start the company and take it public. Fortunes are made in new stock issues, and I love the game.Many people are afraid of small-cap companies and call them\nrisky, and they are. But that risk is diminished if you love what the investment is, understand\nit, and know the game. With small companies, my investment strategy is to be out of the stock\nin a year. On the other hand, my real estate strategy is to start small and keep trading up for\nbigger properties and, therefore, delay paying taxes on the gain. This allows the value to\nincrease dramatically. I generally hold real estate less than seven years.\n\n\nWhen I say mind  your own business, I mean to build and keep your asset column strong.\nOnce a dollar goes into it, never let it come out. Think of it this way\"\nOnce a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations. Keep your day job, be a great hardworking\nemployee, but keep building that asset column.\n\n- start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities.\n\n** Chapter - 4 : The history of taxes and the power of corporations.\nMy rich dad just played the game smart, and he did it through corporations the biggest secret of the rich.\nKnowledge is power.

It was flattering, but I could hear my rich dad asking in my ear.\n\"Who are you working for? Who are you making rich?\"\n\nwhen someone sues a wealthy individual, they are often met with layers of legal protection and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing.

Because you want  to be the person who creates his own luck.\n\nif you are the right kind of person who is waiting for the right thing to happen.

Often, the best deals that make the rich even richer are reserved for those who understand the game.\n\nIt's not gambling if you know what you're doing. It is gambling, if you're just throwing money into a deal and praying.\n\nSo whenever I hear someone say, \"You can't do that here,\" pointing at me, I remind them that maybe the real statement is, \"I don't know how to do that here -- yet.\"\n\nGreat opportunities are not seem with your eyes.

At its simplest, it comes down to getting a\ncomputer to do what you want it to do (or what your user wants it to do). As\na programmer, you are part listener, part advisor, part interpreter, and\npart dictator. You try to capture elusive requirements and find a way of\nexpressing them so that a mere machine can do them justice. You try to\ndocument your work so that others can understand it, and you try to\nengineer your work so that others can build on it. What's more, you try to do\nall this against the relentless ticking of the project clock. You work small\nmiracles every day.\n** What Kind of technology Should I learn?\nYou shouldn't be wedded to any\nparticular technology, but have a broad enough background and experience\nbase to allow you to choose good solutions in particular situations. Your\nbackground stems from an understanding of the basic principles of\ncomputer science, and your experience comes from a wide range of practical\nprojects.

As each new piece floats by they painfully swim over, hoping it will be better. At the end of the day, though, it doesn't\nmatter how good the flotsam is, the developers are still aimlessly adrift.\n\n** Ubiquitous Automation\nLet the computer do the repetitious, the mundane도을t will do a better job of it than we would. We've got more\nimportant and more difficult things to do.\n** Ruthless Testing\nPragmatic Programmers are different. We are driven to find our bugs now, so we don't\nhave to endure the shame of others finding our bugs later.\n\nFinding bugs is somewhat like fishing with a net. We use fine, small nets (unit tests) to catch the minnows, and big,\ncoarse nets (integration tests) to catch the killer sharks. Sometimes the fish manage to escape, so we patch any holes\nthat we find, in hopes of catching more and more slippery defects that are swimming about in our project pool\n\nTests that run with every build are much more\neffective than test plans that sit on a shelf.\n\n\"Code a little, test a little\" is a popular saying in the Smalltalk\nworld\n\nOnce a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug. The automated tests should\nbe modified to check for that particular bug from then on, every time, with no exceptions, no matter how trivial, and\nno matter how much the developer complains and says, \"Oh, that will never happen again.\"\n\nwe just don't have the time to go chasing after bugs that the automated tests could\nhave found for us. We have to spend our time writing new code도으nd new bugs.\n\ncomments should discuss why something is done, its purpose and its goal. The code already shows how it\nis done, so commenting on this is redundant도으nd is a violation of the DRY principle.\n\n** Great Expectation\nTry to surprise your users. Not scare them, mind you, but delight them.\n** Pride and Prejudice\nPragmatic Programmers don't shirk from responsibility. Instead, we rejoice in accepting challenges and in making our\nexpertise well known. If we are responsible for a design, or a piece of code, we do a job we can be proud of.\n\nWe want to see pride of ownership. \"I wrote this, and I stand behind my work.\" Your signature should come to be\nrecognized as an indicator of quality. People should see your name on a piece of code and expect it to be solid, well\nwritten, tested, and documented. A really professional job.

Find a market도 define your\ncustomers도읎hen find or develop a product for them.\n\n- Be a member of your target market and don't speculate\nwhat others need or will be willing to buy.\n\nIt is said that if everyone is you customer, then no one is your\ncustomer. If you start off aiming to sell a product to dog- or car-\nlovers, stop.\n\nIt's  more profitable to be a big fish in a small pond rather than a small undefined fish in a large pond.\n\nask yourself the following questions ot find profitable niches.\n1. which social, industry, and professional groups do you belonged to, or do you understand?\n2. Whether Dentists, engineers, rock climbers, recreational cyclists, car restoration aficionados, dancers, or other?\n\nLook creatively at your resume, work experience, physical habits, and hobbies and compile a list of all the groups, past and present, that you\ncan associate yourself with.\n\nStrive to be the largest, best or first in a precise category. I prefer being first.\n\nLook at products and books you own, include online and offline subscriptions, and ask your-self, \"What groups of people purchase the same?\"\nWhich Magazines, websites and newsletters do you read on a regular basis?\n\n*** Brainstorm (Do not Invest in) Products\nGenius is only a superior power of seeing. - John Ruskin, famed art and social critic.\n\nVisit a large bookstore such as Barnes & Noble and browse the\nmagazine rack for smaller specialty magazines to brainstorm\nadditional niches. There are literally thousands of occupation- and\ninterest/hobby-specific magazines to choose from. Use Writer's\nMarket to identify magazine options outside the bookstores.\nNarrow the groups from question 1 above to those that are reach-\nable through one or two small magazines. It's not important that\nthese groups all have a lot of money (e.g., golfers)도읊nly that\nthey spend money (amateur athletes, bass fishermen, etc.) on\nproducts of some type. Call these magazines, speak to the ad-\nvertising directors, and tell them that you are considering adver-\ntising; ask them to e-mail their current advertising rate card and\ninclude both readership numbers and magazine back-issue\nsamples. Search the back issues for repeat advertisers who sell\ndirect-to-consumer via 800 numbers or websites도읎he more repeat\nadvertisers, and the more frequent their ads, the more profitable a\nmagazine is for them... and will be for us.\n\nPick the two markets that you are most familiar with that have their own magazines with full-page advertising that costs\nless than $5000. There should be no fewer than 15,000 readers.\n\nThis is the fun part. Now we get to brainstorm or find products with these two markets in mind.\nThe goal is come up with well-formed product ideas and spend nothing;\n\nin step 3 we will create advertising for them and test responses from real customers before investing in manufacturing. There are several\ncriteria that ensure the end product will fit into an automated architecture.\n\nThe main benefit should be encapsulated in one sentence.\n\nPeople can dislike you - and you often sell more by offending some - but they should never misunderstand you.\nThe main benefit of your product should be explainable in one sentence or phrase. How is it different and why should I buy it?\n\nexample : iPod [1000] songs in your pocket.\n\nDo not move ahead until you can do this without confusing people.\n\n- It should cost the customer $50 - 200.\nThe bulk of companies set prices in the midrange, and that is where the most competition is. Pricing low is shortsighted, because some-one else is always willing to sacrifice more profit\nmargin and drive you both bankrupt. Besides perceived value, there are three main benefits to creating a premium, high-end image and chargin more that the competition.\n\n\n1. Higher pricing means that we can sell feweer units and thus manage fewer customers - and fulfill our dreamlines. It's faster\n2. Higher pricing attracts lower-maintenance customers (better credit, fewer complaints/questions, fewer returns, et.c). It's less headache. This is HUGE.\n3. Higher pricing also creates higher profit Margins. It's safer.\n\n\nIt should Take No More than 3-4 weeks to manufacture. This is critically important for keeping costs low and adapting to sales demand without stockpiling product\nin advance.\n\nIt should be fully explainable in a good online FAQ.\n\n*** Option one: Resell a product.\n\nPurchasing an existing product at wholesale and reselling it is the easiest route but also least profitable.\n\n*** Option two: license a product\nI not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow. - Woodrow Wilson.\n\nthe real profit has been in licensing - granting others the right to produce hundreds of products with their name and image in exchange for a percentage of sales.\n\nThere are two parties involved in a licensing deal\n\n*** Option Three - Create a product.\n*** I'm no expert.\nif your dreamline - to compete in the 1,150-mile iditarod dogsledding race in Alaska - requires $5000 to realize. If there are 15,000 readers and even 50\n(0.003%) can be convinced of your superior expertise in skill X and sepnd $100 for a program that teaches ti, that is $5,000. Bring on the Huskies. Those 50 customers\nare what I call the \"minimal Customer base\" - the minimum nimber of customers you need to convince of your expertise to fulfill a given dreamline.\n\n1. How can you tailor a general skill for your market - what I call \"Niching Down\" - or add to what is being sold successfully in your target magazines? Think narrow and deep rather than broad.\n2. What skills are you interested in that you - and others in your markets - would pay to learn? Become an expert in this skill for yourself and create a product to teach the same.\n3. What experts could you interview and record to create a sellable audio CD? These People do not need to be the best, nut just better than most. Offer them a digital\nmaster copy of the interview to do with or sell as they like (this is often enough) and/or offer them a small up-front or ongoing royalty payment.\n\n*** The Expert Builder: How to Become a Top Expert in 4 Weeks\nIt took a friend of mine just three weeks to become a \"top relationship expert who, as featured in Glamour and other national media, has counseled executives at Fortune 500 Companies on how to improve their relationships in 24 hours or less\" How did she do it?\nShe followed a few simple steps that created a credibility snowball effect. Here's how you can do the same.\n\n1. Join two / three related trade organizations.\nwith official-sounding names. In her case, she chose the Association for Conflict Resolution (www.acrnet.org) and the International Foundation\nfor Gender Education (www.ifge.org). this can be done online in five minutes with a credit card.\n\n2. Read the three top-selling books\non your topic (search historical New York Times bestseller lists online) and summarize each on one page.\n\n3. Give one free one-to-three-hour seminar at the closest well known university,\nusing posters to advertise. Then do the same at branches of two well-known big companies (AT&T, IBM et.c) located in the same area. Tell teh company that you have\ngiven seminars at University X or X college and are a member of those groups from step 1. Emphasize that you are offering it to them for\nfree to get additional speaking experience outside of academics and will not be selling products or services. Record the seminars from Two Angles for later potential use as\na CD/DVD product.\n\n4. Optional: Offer to write one or two articles for trade magazines related to your topics, citing what you have accomplished in steps 1 and 3 for credibility.\nif they decline, offer to interview a known expert and write the article - it still gets your name listed as a contributor.\n\n5. Join ProfNet, which is a service that journalists use to find experts to quote for articles. Getting PR is simple if you stop shouting and start listening.\nUse steps 1, 3, and 4, to demonstrate credibility and online research to respond to journalists queries. Done properly this will get you featured in media ranging from small local publicatiojns to the new York Times and ABC News.\n\nIn modern PR terms, proof of expertise in most fields is shown with group affiliations, client lists, writing credentials, and media mentions, not IQ Points or Ph.D.s.\n\nBe sure to talk with an intellectual property attorney.\n\n22 types of Info Products:\n01.

Why do so many commercials state \"allow\nthree to four weeks for delivery\" if it only takes three to five days for a shipment to get\nfrom New York to California?

Market Selection\nHe chose music and television producers as his market because he is a musician himself and has used these products.\n\n2. Product Brainstorm\n3.

He ordered\nproduct only when people placed orders from him, and product shipped immediately from the manufacturers warehouses. Based on this demand confirmed on eBay\nDoug Created a Yahoo Store with these products and began testing Google Adwords and other PPC Search Engines.\n\n4.

This isn't\nthe problem, in fact, it's necessary so that the entrepreneurs can train outsources later. The problem is that these same entrepreneurs\ndon't know when and how to replace themselves or their homemade infrastructure with something more scalable.\n\nBefore signing on with a call center, get several 800 numbers they answer for current clients and make test calls, asking difficult product-related\nquestoins and gauging sales-abilities. Call each number at least three times(morning, afternoon, and evening) and note the make-or-break\nfactor: wait time.  The phone should be answered within three to four rings, and if you are put on hold, the shorter the wait the better.\nMore than 15 seconds will result in too many abandoned calls and waste advertising dollars.\n*** The art of undecission: fewer options = More Revenue\nCompanies go out of business when they make the wrong decission, or just as important, make too many decissions.

So we need to be subtle - congenial yet cunning, democratic yet devious.\n\ninstead of using coercion or outright treacher, the perfect courtier got his way through seduction, charm, deception, and subtle\nstrategy, always planning several moves ahead. Life in the court was a never-ending game that required\nconstant vigilance and tactical thinking. It was civilized war.\n\n/Napoleon advised: Place your iron hand inside a velvet glove./\n\nAnd if they do not realize what you have done, they will neither resent nor resist you.\n\nIf the game of power is inescapable, better to be an artist\nthan a denier or a bungler.\n\nRelated to mastering YOUr emotions is the ability to distance YOUfseif\nfrom the present moment and think objectively about the past and future.\n\nLike Janus, the double faced Roman deity and guardian of all gates and doorways, you must be able to look in both directions at once,\nthe better to handle danger from wherever it comes. Such is the face you must create for yourself - one face\nlooking continuously to the future and the other to the past.\n\nFor the future, the motto is, \"N o days unalert.\" N othing should catch\nyou by surprise because you are constantly imagining problems before\nthey arise. Instead of spending your time dreaming of YOUf plan's happy\nending, you must work on calculating every possible permutation and pit셒nfall that might emerge in it. The further you see, the more steps ahead you\nplan, the more powerful you become\n\nHalf of the game is learning how to forget those events in the past that eat away at you and cloud your reason.\nThe real purpose of the backward glancing eye is to eduacate yourself constantly - you look at the past to learn\nfrom those who came before you.\n\nPower requires the ability to play with appearanees. To this end you\nmust learn to wear many masks and keep a bag full of deceptive tricks.\n\nIf deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience\nin all things is your crucial shield.\n\nMastering your emotions\n\none of the most important skills to ac셒nquire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil\n\nin games you do not judge\nyour opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions.\n\nTrain your eye to follow the results of their moves,\nthe outward circumstances, and do not be distracted by anything else.\n\nHalf of your mastery of power comes from what you do\nyou do\nto judge all things by what they cost you. As Nietzsche wrote, \"The value of\na thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays\nfor it-what it costsus.\" Perhaps you will attain your goal, and a worthy goal\nat that, but at what price?\n\nNever waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of\nothers-that is too high a price to pay.\n\nyou must develop the\nability to study and understand people.\n\nTo be a\nmaster player you must also be a master psychologist. You must recognize\nmotivations and see through the cloud of dust with which people surround\ntheir actions\n\n/Never discriminate as to whom you study and/\n/whom you trust. Never trust anyone completely and study everyone, in/\n/cluding friends and loved ones./\n\nFinally, you must leam always to take the indirect route to power. Dis셒nguise your cunning. Like a billiard ball that caroms several times before it\nhits its target, your moves must be planned and developed in the least ob셒nvious way. By training yourself to be indirect, you can thrive in the modem\ncourt, appearing the paragon of decency while being the consummate ma셒nnipulator.\n\n*** Law 1 - NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER\n*** Law 2 - NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, LEARN HOW TO USE ENEMIES\n#+BEGIN_QUOTE\nBe wary of friends-they will betray you more quickly, for\nthey are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled\nand tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be\nmore loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove.\nIn fact, you have more to fear from friends than from en셒nemies.

Keep friends for friendship,\nbut work with the skilIed and competent.\n\nYour enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that you\nmust learn to exploit.\n\nWithout enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels\nsharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert.\n\nMao's strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First,\nbe certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a\nfight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the\nJapanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent ene셒nmies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even tuming a friend\ninto an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use\nsuch enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing\nit as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged China's dis셒nagreements with the Soviet U nion and the U nited States; without clear-cut\nenemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese\nCommunism meant.\nA sharply defined\nenemy is a far stronger argument\nfor your side than all the words you could possibly put together.\n\nKnow how to use enemies for your own profit. Yoiu must learn to grab a sword not by its blade, which woud cut you,\nbut by the handle, which allows you to defend yourself. The wise man profits more from his enemies,\nthan a fool from his friends. - Baltasar Gracian.\n\n*** Law 3 - CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS\nKeep people off-balance and in the dark by never reveal셒ning the pur pose behind your actions. If they have no clue\nwhat you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide\nthem far enough down the wrang path, envelop them in\nenough smoke, and by the time they realize your inten셒ntions, it will be too late.\n\n\nYour honesty is likely to offend\npeople; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what\nthey want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or\nthink. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so\npredictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you,\nand power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.\n\nYou will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly,\nopen, and trusting; you conceal YOUf intentions; and you send YOUf rivals\non time-consuming wild-goose ehases.\n\nThe best deceivers do everything they can to cloak their\nroguish qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise\ntheir dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal\nof weapons.\n\nThe paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive.\nWin their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their\nview in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating\nblow.\n\n\n\nHave you ever heard of a skillful general, who intends to\nsurprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy? Conceal your\npurpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your\ndesigns until they cannot be opposed, until the combat is over. Win\nthe victory before you declare the war. In a word, imitate those war셒nlike people whose designs are not known except by the ravaged coun셒ntry through which they have passed.\n\n\n*** Law 4 - Always Say Less than Necessary\nWhen you are trying to impress people with words, the\nmore you say, the more common you appear, and the less\nin control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will\nseem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and\nsphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by\nsaying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to\nsay something foolish.\n\n** # Aug 23\nNever start moving your own lips and teeth before\nthe subordinates do. The longer I keep quiet, the sooner others\nmove their lips and teeth. As they move their lips and teeth, I\ncan thereby understand their real intentions .... If the sovereign\nis not mysterious, the ministers will find opportunity to take\nand take\n\n*** Law 5 - SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION-GUARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE\nIn the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one out-standing quality, whether generosity or honesty or\ncunning.\nThis quality sets you apart and gets other people to talk about you. You then make your reputation known to as many people as possible\n(subtly, though; take care to build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like wildfire.\n\nA solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates  your strengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also creaet\nan aura around you that will instill respect, even fear.\n\nMake your reputation simple and abse it on one sterling quality. This single qualityo - efficiency, say, or deductiveness - becomes a kind of calling\ncard that announces you presence and places others under a spell.\n\nA reputation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception. Casanova used his reputation as a great seducer to pave the\nway for his future conquests; women who had heard of his powers became immensely curious, and wanted to discover for themselves what had made him so\nromantically successful.\n\nReputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Especially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, anticipating\nall attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies that reveals insecurity, not\nconfidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and never appear desperate in your self-defense.\n\nA mine full of diamonds and rubies. You dug for it, you found it, and your wealth for granted, and constantly renew it - time will diminish the jewels' luster, and bury them from sight.\n\nBurning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born with. You have to lern to attract attention, \"as surely as the lodestone attracts iron.\"\n\nAt the start of your career, you must attach your name and reputation to a quality, an image that sets you apart from other people.\nThis image can be something like a characterstics style of dress, or a personality quirk that amuses people and gets talked about.\nOnce the image is established, you have an appearance, a place in the sky for your star.\n\nPeople feel superior to the person whose actions they can predict. If you show them who is in control by playing against their expectations, you both gain their respect\nand tighten your hold on their fleeting attention.\n\n** # Aug 24\n*** Law 7 - Let Others do the work for you but you always take the credit.\n\n** # Aug 27\nThis is the essence of the law: learn to get others to do the work for you while you take the credit ,and you appear to be of godlike\nstrength and power. If ou thingk it important to do all the work yourself, you will never get far, and you will suffer the fate of the Balboas\nand Teslas of the world. Find people witht the skills and creativity you lack.\nEither hire them, while Find putting your own name on top of theirs, or find a way to take their work and make it your own. Their Creativity thus becomes yours,\nand you seem a genius to the wrodl.\n\nThere is another way to take the credits. i.e. Newton -> Standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\nYou can slog through life, making endless mistakes, wasting time and energy trying to do things from your own experience. Or you can use\nthe armies of the past. As Bismarck Once said, \"Fools say that they learn by experience. I say profit from their experience.\"\n\n*** Law 8 - Make other people come to you - use bait if necessary.\n\nwhen you force the other person to act,\nyou are the one in control.\nIt is always better to make your opponent come to you,\nabandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains - then attack. You hold the cards.\n\nIn the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of chasing here and there, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies,\nif I never geel in control? Why am I always having to react to events instead of directing them? The answer is simple: You idea of power is wrong. You have\nmistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most often the most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be frustrated by the traps\nyou lay for them, playing for long-term power rather than quick victory.\n\nThe essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative, to get others to react to your moves, to keep your opponent and those around you on the defensive.\n\nOne added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the Japanese discovered with the Russians, is that it forces him to operate in your territorry. Being on\nhostile ground will make him nervous and often he will rush his actions and make mistakes.\n\nIf you can let other people dig their own selves then why sweat yourself?\n\n** # Aug 28\n**** Reversal\n\n\n* The C Programming Language Aug 23\n* ZSH Manual Aug 25\n* The Linux Programming Interface Aug 27\n** # AUG 29\n** # AUG 31\n#+BEGIN_SRC C\n\n  cnt = read(fd, buf, numbytes);\n  if (cnt == -1){\n    if(errno == EINTR){\n      fprintf(stderr, \"read was interrupted by a signal\\n\");\n    }\n    else {\n      /* Some other error occured */\n    }\n  }\n\n#+END_SRC\n\n* The Book Thief Aug 28\n* Competitive Programmer's Handbook - Aug 8 ->\n* Download Links\n럾탶着쟆着럾읹 럾잁럾촆搾럾읷럾읿럾 럾윉럾쑾着챞着 럾잃럾윜럾읻럾쭢着샢着쑾着 - https://www.mediafire.com/folder/lj1q45kylmwx6\n\n\nExcuse Me.\nI am Alamin.\nI know this is going to sound strange, but if I don't ask you now, I'll be kicking myself for the rest of the day.\nI was on facebook to check notifications and there I saw you.\nTrust me, I have works to do and I am not a stalker.\nbut I think you are really cute.\nCould I have your phone Number?\nI'm not a psycho -- I promise.\nYou can give me a fake one if you're not interested. :)\n\n\n** Interrupting - Interruption and the art of refusal.\n\nDo your own thinking independently.
